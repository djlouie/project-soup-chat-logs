Recording of my logs for project soup

I had never taken a Unity class before my capstone game's class, I decided to fully leverage LLMs when I could as my philosophy on this project was to boost my knowledge as fast as possible and to output good quality work I could as much as possible. Learning a new game engine and its many intricacies is already a task with many facets, but to do so and make a good polished game to eventually publish on Steam meant that this was a good choice. Thus this is an interesting documentation of my journey learning Unity and an experiment in fully leveraging LLMs to learn a Game Engine from scratch, in the process of making a game.

I've also put recordings of useful Unity tutorials I used when making project soup.
