what are the things in a scene in unity called again?

In Unity, the things you place in a scene are called GameObjects.

GameObjects are the fundamental building blocks of any scene. They can represent anything from a player character, environment objects (like trees or buildings), lights, cameras, or even empty placeholders for organizational purposes.

GameObjects can have Components, which define their behavior or appearance. For example:

A Transform component defines the position, rotation, and scale of the GameObject in the scene.

A MeshRenderer component makes the GameObject visible in the scene by rendering its geometry.

A Script component lets you add custom behavior.

To see the script attached to a GameObject in Unity, follow these steps:

Select the GameObject in the Scene or Hierarchy:
Click on the GameObject you want to inspect. It will highlight in the Inspector window.

Look at the Inspector Panel:
In the Inspector window, you'll see a list of all components attached to the selected GameObject. Find the script component (it will be named after your script file).

View the Script:

To open the script, click on the small gear icon next to the script component’s name and choose Edit Script.

Alternatively, you can double-click on the script name in the Inspector, and it will open in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).

Optional: Find the Script File Directly in Assets

Right-click the script component in the Inspector and select Find Script to locate it in your project’s Assets folder. You can then open it from there.
